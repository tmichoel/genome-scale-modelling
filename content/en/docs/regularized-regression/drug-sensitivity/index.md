Abstract - **What** is the study about and **why** was it performed?

What is a cancer cell line? See

- [NCI dictionary](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cancer-cell-line)
- [CCLE homepage](https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/)

Which genomic profiles were generated?

Are cell lines good models for real tumours? Figure 1.

What are pharmacological profiles, how is drug sensitivity measured?

What is predictive modelling, how were robust models derived, what is shown in Figure 2?
